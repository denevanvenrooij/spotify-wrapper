## Spotify Wrapper by Dene
This Python script summarizes all your end-of-the-year Spotify Wrapped playlists into one playlist, which is added to your account and named **Spotify Wrapped-up**. I need to add your Spotify-account mail address to my project on the Spotify Developer website to make it work though, or you need to have your own Spotify Developer account. Message me if you want me to add your account!

The first step is that you need to follow all the Spotify Wrapped top-100 playlists that were created for you by Spotify. To do this follow these instructions:
    - Find the end-of-the-year Spotify Wrapped playlists by searching for 'Your Top Songs 20..' on Spotify, and make sure to check if these were uploaded by the Spotify-account (Made for you) and not by other users.
    - Add the playlists to your account. Not by following them, but by selecting 'Add to other playlist' under options (three dots) and selecting 'Add to new playlist'. Your Spotify Wrapped playlist is now a personal playlist in your account, not made __for__ you but __by__ you.
    - Do this for every Spotify Wrapped playlist that you want to include.
    - **DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES OF THESE PLAYLISTS. THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK**

## Prerequisites
No need to install Python or dependencies! The script has been packaged into an executable.

## How to Run:

1. **Download the Executable**: Download and navigate to the `your_script.exe` (Windows) or `your_script` (macOS/Linux).

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - On **Windows**, double-click `spotify_wrapper.exe` to run the program.
   - On **macOS/Linux**, open the terminal, navigate to the folder containing `spotify_wrapper`, and run:
     ```bash
     ./spotify_wrapper
     ```

3. **Spotify Login**: When the script runs, you will be prompted to log in to your Spotify account in your browser.

4. **Enjoy Your Playlist**: Once logged in, the script will create a new playlist called 'Spotify Wrapped-up' for you based on the End of the year playlists that were provided.

## Notes
- This script uses my Spotify Developer credentials, please do not post this data online. Additionally, it should be noted that you need a Spotify account with Spotify Wrapped playlists to use this script.
